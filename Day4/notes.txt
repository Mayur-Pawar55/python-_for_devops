Day 4 – File Handling & Log Monitoring (DevOps Notes)
1. Why File Handling is Important in DevOps

DevOps engineers work with files every day:

* Application logs
* System logs
* Config files
* Reports
* Backup files

Python helps you:

* Read logs
* Write reports
* Scan errors
* Automate monitoring

2. Opening a File

Use `open()` function.

file = open("app.log", "r")

Modes:

"r" → read
"w" → write (overwrite)
"a" → append
"r+" → read + write

3. Reading a File

🔹 Read full file

file = open("app.log", "r")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()

🔹 Read line by line (BEST for logs)

file = open("app.log", "r")

for line in file:
    print(line)

file.close()

✔ Best for large log files

4. Writing to a File

file = open("report.txt", "w")
file.write("Server is healthy\n")
file.close()

"w" will delete old content

5. Append to a File

Used for logs and reports.

file = open("report.txt", "a")
file.write("New log entry\n")
file.close()

6. Using `with` Statement (Recommended)**

Automatically closes file.

with open("app.log", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line)

✔ Cleaner
✔ Safer
✔ Professional style

7. Log Monitoring Example

with open("app.log", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        if "ERROR" in line:
            print("Error found:", line)

✔ Real production use case
✔ Interview-friendly

8. Counting Errors in Log File**

count = 0

with open("app.log", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        if "ERROR" in line:
            count += 1

print("Total errors:", count)

9. Writing Error Report

with open("error_report.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("ERROR found in application\n")

10. Check File Exists**

Very common DevOps task.

import os

if os.path.exists("app.log"):
    print("Log file exists")
else:
    print("Log file not found")

11. Read File Safely (Try / Except)

try:
    with open("app.log", "r") as file:
        print(file.read())
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found")

✔ Prevents script crash
✔ Production-ready

12. DevOps Use Cases

* Monitor logs for errors
* Generate reports
* Audit server activity
* Validate config files
* Alerting systems

🧠 Day 4 Summary

* Learned file read/write
* Learned safe file handling
* Learned log monitoring
* Learned error counting
* Used Python like real DevOps engineers
