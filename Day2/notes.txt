Day 2 – Conditions & Loops (DevOps Notes)**

1. IF / ELSE (Decision Making)

Used when we want to check a condition and decide.

Syntax:

if condition:
    # do something
else:
    # do something else

Example:

status = "running"

if status == "running":
    print("Server is healthy")
else:
    print("Server is down")

DevOps usage:

* Check server status
* Check file exists
* Check disk usage
* Validate user access

2. ELIF (Multiple Conditions)

tool = "Docker"

if tool == "Docker":
    print("Container tool")
elif tool == "Terraform":
    print("IaC tool")
else:
    print("Unknown tool")

3. FOR Loop

Used when:

* You have a list
* You know how many times to loop

 Syntax:

for item in list:
    print(item)

 Example:

servers = ["web1", "db1", "cache"]

for s in servers:
    print(f"Checking {s}")


DevOps usage:

* Loop through servers
* Loop through logs
* Loop through AWS resources

4. WHILE Loop

Used when:

* we don’t know how many times to repeat
* we wait until a condition changes

Syntax:

while condition:
    # keep running

 Example:


status = "starting"

while status != "running":
    print("Waiting for server...")
    status = "running"

 DevOps usage:

* Retry logic
* Waiting for pod/server
* Polling status

5. BREAK

Stops the loop completely.

for s in servers:
    if s == "db1":
        break

Used when:

* want to stop early

6. CONTINUE

Skips current iteration and moves to next.

for s in servers:
    if s == "cache":
        continue
    print(s)

Used when:

we want to ignore certain items

7. Using IF Inside Loops

Very common in DevOps.

for s in servers:
    if s.startswith("db"):
        print("Database server")

8. Range Function

Used to generate numbers.

for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

9. Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Printing list instead of loop variable
* Using `len(variable)` instead of counter
* Using `range` as a variable name
* Wrong indentation (very important!)

🧠 Day 2 Summary

* Learned decision making with `if / else`
* Learned repetition with `for` and `while`
* Learned control using `break` and `continue`
* Applied logic to real DevOps scenarios
